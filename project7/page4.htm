<h1> choosing the right commuter bike </h1>
<p> if you decided that a commuter bike is right for you, you have some options to choose from:</p>
<ol>
<li>road bikes that are made for comfort</li>
	<li>foldable bikes</li>
</ol>
<h2>Road bikes</h2>
<div id="pictureleft"><img src="images/comfortroadbike.jpg" alt="picture of a road bike" height="200 px" width="200px" /></div>
<p>well there are two types of road bikes, one of them is used for competition&nbsp; 
and then there are the other ones that are made for complete comfort. Majority of 
these road bikes can be custom made to suit your needs. normally these bikes are 
custom made, shop owners measure the person buying the bicycle in order to get 
the custom bike to the measurements that will allow the user to have maximum 
comfort.</p>
<p>some of these bikes in the forks, have dampers built in the bike in order to 
absorb the <span lang="en-us"></span>shock of any bump in the road. however they look exactly like a 
competition road bike with the difference that the handle bars are much bigger 
and have a much wider seat then regular conventional road bikes</p>
<p>the cost of these bikes tend to range from $78 to about $2000 dollars. 
however a good comfortable road bike cost on the average of about $300-$400 at a bike shop or and  $78- $300 at 
Wal-Mart/target </p>
<h2>foldable bikes</h2>
<div class="extrapicture"><img src="images/foldable.jpg" alt="picture of foldable bike" height="200px" width="250px"/></div>
<p>well what exactly are fodable bikes? well foldable bikes are exactly that. 
they are foldable road bikes that are meant to be folded up and be taken inside 
of buses as well as trains. these bikes however are not as comfortable as one 
would expect. but if you plan to use public transit with your commute these 
bikes are very convenient with your travels since the fold up to a size of a 
fully loaded backpack.</p>
<p>however these bikes are not the cheapest bikes. these bikes have a selling 
range of&nbsp; $329 to about $3000 dollars. so you can not go to target and buy 
a cheap $100 dollar bike. but the cost is worth it if you use public transit 
since if the bike bays are full, you will not have to wait for the next train or 
bus to show up.</p></div>
