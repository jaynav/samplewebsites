<h1>choosing the recreational bike that is right for you</h1>
<p>well by know, you have chosen that you may want a recreational bike. but now, 
you are confused with the selection of bicycles since there is many choices. 
they include:</p>
<ol><li>mountain bikes </li>
	<li>Bmx bikes</li>
	<li>cruisers</li>

</ol>
<h2> Cruiser bikes</h2>
<div id="pictureleft">
<img src="images/cruiser.jpg" alt="image of a cruiser bike" height="180px" width="250px"/></div>
<p> well first of all, one may be wondering what exactly is a cruiser bicycle. a 
cruiser bicycle is a bike that is really made for comfort and occasional use. 
many people when they think about these bikes, they think of the old Schwinn 
bikes. these bikes range from anywhere from 69 dollars to about 850 dollars. the 
more expensive the bike, the more comfortable they tend to because some bike 
shops are more than willing to sell you a custom cruiser which are fitted for 
maximum comfort</p>
	<p> &nbsp;</p>
	<p> &nbsp;</p>
<h2> BMX bikes</h2>

<p> well bmx bikes were originally made as a mutant cruiser bike meant for 
jumping ramps. these bikes though people tend to use them as everyday bikes even 
though they are somewhat similar to cruisers, the comfort is not there due to 
the elongated bike frame and the short handle bars. these bikes range from S49 to S650.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;</p>
	<p> &nbsp;</p>
	<p> &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Mountain Bikes</h2>
<div class="extrapicture"><img src="images/100_0039.JPG" alt="dual shock mtb bike" height="180px" width="220px"/></div>
<p>well these bikes are some of the most complicated bikes in my own opinion. 
these bikes have a tendency to be different. some have no suspension, front 
suspension and full suspension. the sturdiness of the bikes depend of you are 
going to jump 3+ foot cliffs going downhill at full speed and&nbsp; mountain 
trails that are more for scenic view. these bikes are really meant to be used 
for mountain use. However, you see many people riding these around town; maybe 
because the streets are in very bad condition.</p>
<div class="extrapicture1"><img src="images/frontshock.jpg" alt="one shock mtb bike" height="180px" width="220px"/></div>

<p>mountain bikes with a full suspension are meant to take on abuse that one may 
not be able to do with a regular bmx or cruiser bike. majority of these bikes 
have a tendency to be made so someone can jump them off a 6-10 foot cliff 
without worrying about snapping the bike frame. these bikes mostly all come with 
two disk brakes in order to aid the rider for stopping</p>
<div class="extrapicture"><img src="images/noshockMTB.jpg" alt="no shock mtb bike" height="180px" width="220px"/></div>

<p>front and no suspension bikes are made more for regular scenic trail use. 
these bikes people rarely use them for jumping but for going up or down hills( 
these bikes have a tendency to either have one or no disk brake equipped with 
them.</p>
<p>these bikes though are comfortable in a mountain terrain, but have a tendency to 
not be comfortable for regular everyday use mostly because of the smaller seat. 
these bikes range from $74 dollars all the way up to in excess of $13,000. 
however the more expensive the bike, the lighter the bike is(the most expensive 
bikes wheigh less than 10 pounds) and the more durable the bike it is(bikes made 
of carbon fiber cost over $3000)</p></div>
