<h1>bikes suited for small errands</h1>
<p>well here there are some few choices as well. these bikes although can have 
come with a bike that is meant for small errands</p>
<ol>
<li>a tricycle</li>
	<li>a trailer adapter </li>
	<li>adapter for baskets</li>
</ol>

<h2>adding a basket</h2>
<div id="pictureleft"><img src="images/basket.jpg" alt="images of a bike basket" height="200" width="200" /></div>
<p>well the cheapest alternative for making your errands while not using your 
car would be to add basket/ basket like accessories to your bicycle. They attach 
almost anywhere on the bicycle. the only issue with these is that you will have 
to add several to do a small shopping trip. the other issue with these is that 
if you add to much weight and you are leaning during a turn, it may cause you to 
fall due to the weight pushing you to the side. therefore you must have good 
balance if you are carrying heavy loads in these bags.&nbsp; the price for these 
bags are around $30 dollars although there are cheaper ones.</p>

<h2> adding a trailer adapter</h2>

<div class="extrapicture">

alt="child trailer picture" height="170" width="220px" /></div>
<p> trailer adapters are very useful for two reasons, one you can buy an adapter 
to take you kids with you or you can use it to carry more things when you go 
shopping. trailers are a convenient way to take your kids with you on short 
trips. they adapt to almost any bike that is currently available in the market. 
the current cost of bike trailers cost around $74 dollars to $300 dollars</p>
	<p> &nbsp;</p>
<h2>buying a tricycle</h2>
<div class="extrapicture1"><img src="images/khsadultricycle.jpg" alt="trike" height="180px" width="220px"/></div>


<p>well many think that buying a tricycle is something that small children get 
before they learn to use a bicycle. even thought that is true, they offer a 
comfortable ride that will allow you to take around town in style while being 
able to load things in the back of your seat without worrying that you are going 
to fall over in a turn. these bikes also start out somewhat expensive too. the 
cheapest bikes are around $249 and they  already come with a pretty good size 
steel basket that can carry about 50Lbs of items. the more expensive tricycles 
cost (the highest amount is about $710 dollars) the more features you get such 
as multispeed bikes&nbsp; and they are lighter too.</p>
