<h1>buying a bicycle </h1>
<p> well buying a bicycle is more than just going to your local supercenter and getting the cheapest bike. </p>
<p> the one thing that one must consider when buying a bicycle is how a person is going to use a bicycle</p>
<div class="extrapicture1"><img src="images/flowers.jpg" alt="pictures of flowers" height="180px" width="220px"/></div>

<ol>
<li>is one going to use the bike at recreational bike, commuter bike, or a 
everyday shopping bike(one that can hold your groceries)</li>
	<li>if recreational how is one going to use that bike<ol>
		<li>on the mountains</li>
		<li>on the street</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>if commuter<ol>
		<li>does one need a bike for convenience </li>
		<li>does one need a for comfort</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>if you are using it for small errands in your local community<ol>
		<li>will i need a tricycle for carrying groceries</li>
		<li>will i need an adapter so i can take my kids along with me as well</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>if one has came to the conclusion of what one needs a bicycle for, it is 
always a good thing to ask oneself a very important question.</p>
<blockquote>will i be using this bicycle a lot?<br />
	am i too lazy to pedal by myself?<br />
</blockquote>
<div class="extrapicture"><img src="images/cucamongapeak.jpg" alt="picture looking down onto the san bernardino valley from cucamonga peak" height="180px" width="220px"/></div>


<p> the reason that this question is very important to ask is because one should always consider how much 
one is willing to spend on a bicycle.</p>
<p> bicycle cost ranges from about $49 dollars for a bike at walmart and target 
to bicyles costing well over&nbsp; $7000 dollars at a bike shop.</p>
<p> although a majority of of the people would never go over $1000 dollars for a 
bicycle, one still has to decide how much one is going to spend. if one is only 
going to use the bicycle once a year, then i would suggest that you buy your 
bike at wal-mart. there is no point to spending lots of money from going to a 
bike shop if you are rarely going to use the bicycle. however, you will be 
treated better than staff at target.</p>
<p> if you do decide that that you are too lazy to pedal yourself, well expect 
to end up paying more than $600 dollars for an electric bike. the benefits of an 
electric bike is that untill the battery runs out, you will not have to pedal.</p>
