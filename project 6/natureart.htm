<h1>who can do a better job at drawing art?</h1>
<h2>nature can</h2>

<p>here is a fine example of what nature can do the best</p>
<div id="picture">
<img src="images/trail.jpg" alt="part of trail" height="300px" width="300px"/></div>
<p>last summer, i went riding in this part of of the san bernardino mountains. i thought that the formation of landscape was great. however, on the other side of this 
trail. the same can not be said. the reason for this is because people think that is fun to put graffiti in the rocks. not just any graffiti, hate motivated graffiti. 
miracle that when i took this picture, this side was still not full of graffiti. 
the same can not hold true about a similar trail in lytle creek which leads to a 
waterfall.</p>
<div id="picture2"><img src="images/sunset.jpg" alt="sunset" height="300px" width="300px"/></div>
<p>this picture was taking during sunset with a camera phone. as you can tell, the picture quality is not the best. 
also i did not notice that my finger was in the way. well next time, i will use 
my regular camera...... if i can find it. i truly need to find it because that 
camera cost me more than $1000. its an expensive slr camera.</p>
<div class="picture3"><img src="images/rain.jpg" alt="rain hitting the floor" height="300px" width="300px"/></div>
<blockquote>this was when it was raining, it looks cool how the water is falling 
	off the roof of my house. when the water was hitting the floor, the water 
	pops back up. this is something that a lot of people&nbsp; do not really 
	notice when it starts raining.</blockquote>
